# Sorting Visualizer

A dynamic web application to visualize sorting algorithms, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort with interactive controls and a sleek, modern interface. Perfect for learning and teaching the mechanics of sorting algorithms.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort in action with animated bars.
- **Customizable Controls**: Adjust array size (10–100 elements) and animation speed (10–1000ms delay).
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops and mobile devices with a modern, gradient-based UI.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause and resume sorting to inspect the process step-by-step.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over controls for clear descriptions of their functionality.
- **Reset Functionality**: Generate a new random array to restart the visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styling with gradients, shadows, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for sorting algorithms, animations, and user interactions.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if out of order.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Visualized by highlighting compared elements and animating swaps.
2. **Selection Sort**:
   - Finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Shows the minimum element selection process with color changes.
3. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Builds a sorted array by inserting each element into its correct position.
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Animates the shifting of elements during insertion.

## Setup and Installation
To run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
